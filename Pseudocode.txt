Linked List program
Using nodes structs in C
each struct will contain:
character array [255] (at most)
an unsigned integer (positive int greater than 1)
A pointer to the next node

string will be referred to text and index for the node

linked list is empty at first

REQUIREMENTS

the index is a number of hte node in the list (ie first node is index 1). When the list is scanned from the beginneing to end, the value increases

the texts appearing in teh list are all distinct, no two nodes have the same text

USER ENTERED COMMANDS - must have a separate function for each
-> ina <index> <string user enters[255]> (insert after)
-> inb <index> <string user enteres[255]> (insert before)
-> del <index> deletes node (delete)
-> rep <num> <string user enters [255]> (replace)
-> prn (print list)
-> end (ends program)

command names are case-sensitive
Assume that when commands are entered, there is a space between each argument




-> ina <index> <string user enters[255]> (insert after)
insert after command: 
Every time a new node is added, indexes of list must change as well
Message to console: "OKAY"
No duplicates: If user enter dupes, "Such text exists already" pops up
